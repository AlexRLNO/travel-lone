        <p>Agathonisi is a small island in the Dodecanese island chain, it is not famous for anything to my knowledge due to it being so small</p>
        <p>Agathonisi's charm is it's small size, the community, and the overall quietness of the island.</p>
        <p>The main things to do on the island is explore and go to the beach, the main beach is mikro chorio, but I will also strongly recommend "Παραλία Σπηλιάς" which is much smaller but much nicer although there are a lot of sea urchins so be clear of that. </p>
        <p>For food I would really recommend just exploring around to find a resturant. BUT it is super important to bring atleast 2L of water as the island has problems with that if there are many tourists.

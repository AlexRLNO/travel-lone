        <p>Fourni is a island in greece known for amazing food but sea food especially, which I and my family can atest.
        </p>
        <p>It is a part of the aegean island chain, its closest islands are samos and ikaria.</p>
        <p>The best things to do at fourni in my opinion is to during the day to go to a beach named "kampi", and during the night and afternoon eating the amazing food.</p>

    <p>Astypalea is a greek island in the Dodecanese island chain, One of the first things you will notice on astypalea in the skala area is the castle of Astypalea which is the castle at the top of the skala.</p>
    <p>Astypalea is overall just a beautiful island, I would mostly recommend not going alone, but instead with a close friend, family or lover.</p>
    <p>All though the islands beauty is the main attraction which can allow a complete relaxiation at a bar or resturant this is best enjoyed after a day of activity, for this a good recommandation would be going to beach, in my experiences the best beach is Paralia Livadi but there is probably much better ones I do not know of as I havent explored the whole island yet, allthough I have heard that Kaminakia is good.    </p> 
    <p>You can also of course go to the castle of Astypalea, which I would also recommend but in my opinion it is best to find out yourself what is the best place to be. </p> 
    <p>When it gets darker I would strongly recommend exploring around the skala to find a resturant and if there is an event happening that day I would recommend planning your day around that as it is always fun to watch or be a part of.</p>
    <p>After eating you can go to your room or airbnb or whatever and just relax, which is always a good time. </p>
    <p>My last recommandation is to get a airbnb for example instead of staying over at a hotel.</p>
